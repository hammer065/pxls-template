pxls-template
=============
A UserScript to make a template overlay over the main canvas, so users can pixel big graphics together more easily

----------

Usage
-----

    https://pxls.space/?template=URL&ox=X&oy=Y&tw=W

 - `URL`: **Required**, a URL to the image which should get overlayed.
 - `X`: *Optional*, an offset on the x-axis to position the image on the canvas, defaults to 0.
 - `Y`: *Optional*, an offset on the y-axis to position the image on the canvas, defaults to 0.
 - `W`: *Optional*, sets a custom width to the image. Useful, if the image is not pixel-sized.

Unused parameters should get omitted, for example: `https://pxls.space/?template=URL` is the valid format if you just want to specify the image URL.
